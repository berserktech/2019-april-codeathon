## Problem statement

There is so much information related to the Venezuelan, yet no way to query all that data or access it altogether.

## Challenge

Build a central repository of historic facts and events in general related with Venezuela, with a defined Schema and make it publicly Queryable and Crowdsourced so that visualizations can be easily built (and updated real time) and all similar open-data efforts can use the same platform. 

## Skills needed

- Backend APIs
- Database Design
